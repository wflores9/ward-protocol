## 5. Tone and messaging

Ward Protocol's tone is professional, concise, and focused on institutional DeFi.

Positioning themes:

- Institutional-grade risk and insurance for XRPL DeFi.
- Compatibility with regulated, compliance-aware XRPL use cases.
- Emphasis on transparency, clear parameters, and predictable coverage.

Example boilerplate:

> Ward Protocol is an institutional insurance layer for XRP Ledger (XRPL) DeFi. It provides configurable on-chain cover for institutional participants using XRPL for lending, tokenized assets, and other real-world finance applications.

## 6. Co-branding and naming

When mentioning XRPL or other protocols:

- Use: "Ward Protocol, built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL)."
- Do not modify XRPL's own logo or wordmark.

For Ward-related products:

- Reserve "Ward ..." names for official Ward Protocol components.

Third-party projects should avoid names that could be mistaken for core protocol components.

## 7. Repo usage

In READMEs, docs, and issues:

- Use the full name "Ward Protocol" on first mention.
- Include the logo in the main README.md once, near the top.
- Link to this BRANDING.md for community contributors and integrators.
