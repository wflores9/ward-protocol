## Confirmed On-Chain Transactions

All 5 transactions below can be verified on the XRPL Testnet Explorer.

### 1 — Premium Payment
**Type:** `Payment` (191 drops from depositor → insurance pool)

```

### 2 — Policy NFT Mint
**Type:** `NFTokenMint` — Ward policy, taxon=281, `tfBurnable` only (non-transferable by design)

```
B323815A6C7BA98935D2C2AA3CFC94BB956E59BA716A59430F2183D2AE148CDF

**NFT Token ID:**

```

### 3 — Escrow Create
**Type:** `EscrowCreate` — 0.5 XRP locked with PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto condition + time lock

```
9BB570DBC6CB9EB11339FBBDA4920E03EC2CC49EC547CBF0D031C8AABC48B0A3

**Security note:** The escrow requires *both* a time condition (finish window) and a PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto condition. Only the claimant holding the preimage can finish the escrow — Ward cannot front-run or redirect the payout.

### 4 — Escrow Finish
**Type:** `EscrowFinish` — 0.5 XRP payout released to depositor with valid preimage fulfillment

```
E65C35A568AE93E6D8A628F36A217DACB1B2A7E1A8F0A7B0912E510AED0A3DBB

### 5 — Policy NFT Burn (Replay Protection)
**Type:** `NFTokenBurn` — policy destroyed after settlement; cannot be reused

```

## What Was Simulated (XLS-66 Not Yet on Altnet)

ClaimValidator Steps 4–9 require XLS-66 ledger objects (`Loan`, `LoanBroker`, `Vault`) which are a draft standard not yet deployed on XRPL Altnet. These steps were tested with mock fixtures in the unit test suite (75/75 passing).

When XLS-66 is live (custom devnet or mainnet), `LedgerEntry(index=loan_id)` will return the `Loan` object and all 9 validation steps will run end-to-end.

## Balance Changes (Confirmed On-Chain)

| Wallet | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| `rf3dH3S7...` (depositor) | 101.498 XRP | 101.998 XRP | **+0.499 XRP** (payout received) |
| `rK4dpLy9...` (pool) | 98.501 XRP | 98.001 XRP | **−0.500 XRP** (payout sent + fees) |

## Bug Discovered During Testnet Run

**`get_ledger_time()` — rippled 3.x compatibility**

rippled 3.x removed `close_time` from `ServerInfo.validated_ledger`. The original implementation raised `LedgerError` on every real network call.

**Fix:** `get_ledger_time()` now uses `Ledger(ledger_index='validated').ledger.close_time` as the primary source, with `ServerInfo` as fallback for older nodes.

This is the only code change required to go from unit tests passing → testnet simulation passing.

## Reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wflores9/ward-protocol.git
cd ward-protocol
pip install xrpl-py pytest pytest-asyncio

# Unit tests (no network)
pytest test_ward.py -v -m "not integration"   # 75/75 pass

# Testnet simulation (requires XRPL Altnet)
python testnet_sim.py
```
