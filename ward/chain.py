"""
ward/chain.py — Chain abstraction layer.

Defines the ChainAdapter interface that each chain port must implement.
ward_signed = False on every chain — this never changes.

Usage:
    Each phase port (Flare, Hedera, Solana, Stellar, XDC) subclasses ChainAdapter
    and implements every abstract method using the chain's native RPC/SDK.
    The 9-step validation logic in ClaimValidator is chain-agnostic — only the
    RPC calls injected through this interface differ per chain.

Example:
    class XRPLAdapter(ChainAdapter):
        async def get_ledger_time(self) -> int:
            return await get_ledger_close_time(self._client)

        async def build_unsigned_escrow_create(self, ...) -> dict:
            # Returns EscrowCreate fields — institution signs, Ward never does
            ...
